	\section{Project Proposal}
	Project proposal was already sent by me on SKOS - I am in group with Szymon Kosakowski and Kacper Szufnarowski.
	
	\section{SameGame Easy}
	In order to get at least $6500$ points from the SameGame puzzle I have just written random agent - pick any legal action and perform it.
	
	\section{SameGame Medium}
	In order to get at least $30000$ points from the SameGame puzzle I have written BeamSearch algorithm with no additional enhancements - $50ms$ for every round (including the first one despite $20s$ limit, search did not use any state). To be more exact, I got something around $30500$ points. I have used beam width equal to $100$.
	
	\section{Zobrist Hashing}
	With state hashing I have achieved score of about $38000$ ($37900$ to be exact) - every state was hashed depending on the position of individual tiles. Better score is understandable as with the SameGame, we can get to one state with a different sequence of moves - especially on some levels and especially at the beginning, which could lead to duplicate states in our search, which will lead to worse search effectiveness.
	
	\section{Selective Policy}
	With color taboo policy I have managed to achieved score about $50700$ - I have just added punishment to the current score, if I have decided to press on the most frequent color. This improved the score by aggregating the most frequent color into larger blocks and pressing on then only at the end.
	
	\section{Nested Monte Carlo Search}
	Nested Monte Carlo Search is very costly, but it has proved to be able to find very good solutions. After a few experiments I have decided to run NMCS with depth equal to $2$. I have written NMCS to run in the time constrained manner - I have used $20s$ limit in the first round and $50ms$ in the rest of the rounds (running NMCS for $50ms$ improved just a little bit, $20s$ in the first round was the main part). With pure NMCS I have managed to get the score around $66000$. When I have added color taboo policy I got $107000$ points - when calculating possible moves, I did not consider moves removing the most frequent color as long as a had other moves to do. As we can see this had a major impact on the efficiency of the algorithm. I wanted to deepen the search to $3$, but unfortunately $20s$ was too little time to find meaningful solutions - although better solutions were found, which was not the case with Beam Search - extending time limit did not have such significant impact on the quality of solutions.
